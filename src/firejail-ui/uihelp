<br/><center><b>Sandbox Configuration</b></center><br/><br/><br/>
Although hundreds of user-space applications are already supported by Firejail, 
sometimes is necessary to customize the sandbox environment. This configuration 
wizard was built in order to make this task easier.<br/><br/>
Start with the filesystem configuration, move to the network and 
multimedia subsytems, and finish with the kernel. In the end you can turn on debugging and 
get a trace with all network requests and all file accessed by your application.<br/>
<br/><b>Filesystem</b><br/><br/>
Personal user files are located in home directory.  
By default Firejail denies access to some of the most sensitive files there, 
such as password and encryption keys.  
To enance your privacy, these are some of the options available:<br>
<blockquote>
<i><b>Restrict home directory:</b> Choose private user directories visible inside the sandbox. 
By default, with the exception of some well-known password and encryption files, 
all private user files are visible inside the sandbox.</i><br/><br/>
<i><b>Restrict /dev directory:</b> A small number of very basic devices are visible inside the sandbox. 
Sound and 3D acceleration should also be available if this checkbox is set.<br/><br/>
<b>Restrict /tmp directory:</b> Start with a clean /tmp directory.<br/><br/>
<b>Restrict /mnt and /media:</b> Blacklist /mnt and /media directories.</i><br/><br/>
</blockquote>
<b>Networking</b><br/><br/>
A network namespace is a separate copy of TCP/IP networking stack. 
Initially, all processes share the same networking stack created by the init process. 
Firejail allows users to create a new network namespace, therefore isolating 
the sandbox traffic.

<blockquote>
<i><b>System network:</b></i> Use the default networking stack provided by the system.<br/><br/>
<i><b>Network namespace:</b></i> Install a separate networking stack and connect it to the 
main Ethernet interface. A new IP address is assigned, and a new network filter is installed 
using <i>iptables</i> command.<br/><br/>
<i><b>Disable networking:</b></i> Use an unconnected network stack. There will be no traffic 
coming in or going out of the sandbox.<br/><br/>
<i><b>DNS:</b></i> Specify two DNS nameservers to use inside the sandbox. If none is specified, 
the sandbox will use the system DNS server.<br/><br/>
<i><b>Protocol:</b></i> Select what networking protocols are allowed: unix (regular 
Unix inter-process communication), inet (IPv4), inet6 (IPv6), netlink (socket communication with Linux 
kernel), packt (Ethernet-level protocols).
</blockquote>
<b>Multimedia</b><br/><br/>
If the application is not using sound or 3D acceleration, it is always a good idea to drop the support 
inside the sandbox. Disabling X11 graphic interface is recommended when running servers and console programs.
<blockquote>
<i><b>Disable sound:</b></i> No sound subsystem access inside the sandbox.<br/><br/>
<i><b>Disable video camera devices:</b></i> No video camera access.<br/><br/>
<i><b>Disable CD-ROM/DVD devices:</b></i> No access to CD-ROM device.<br/><br/>
<i><b>Disable TV/DVB devices:</b></i> TV cards are disabled.<br/><br/>
<i><b>Disable 3D acceleration:</b></i> Hardware acceleration drivers are disabled.<br/><br/>
<i><b>Disable X11:</b></i> X11 graphical user interface subsystem is disabled. 
The setting requires a new
network namespace to be configured, see <i>Networking</i> section for more details.
<br/><br/>

<b>Kernel</b><br/><br/>
These are some of the most powerful sandboxing features implemented by the Linux kernel:
<blockquote>
<i><b>Enable seccomp-bpf:</b></i> This security facility allows filtering out the most dangerous system calls 
inside the kernel, therefore reducing the attack surface. 
A Linux Kernel version 3.5 is required for this option to work.<br/><br/>
<i><b>Disable all Linux capabilities:</b></i> Capabilities (POSIX 1003.1e) are designed to split up the root privilege
into a set of distinct privileges which can be independently enabled or disabled. For regular user-space programs,
all these privileges should be disabled.<br/><br/>
<i><b>Restricted user namespace (noroot):</b></i> This option installs a user namespace with a single 
user, the current  user. <i>root</i> user  does  not  exist  in  the new namespace. 
A Linux Kernel version 3.8 is required for this option to work.<br/><br/
