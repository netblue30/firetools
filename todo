1. Documentation: packages needed on Debian Jessie: qt5-default, libqt5svg5, firejail, xterm

2. If a program is uninstalled, do not leave it in the launcher

3. On debian i386, open new xterm sandbox, join it, shut down the join process - it does not shut down!

4. Detecting sandbox features from command line params:
--net detected in pid_thread.cpp (strstr(pids[pid].cmd, "--net")), it might pick it up from the
params of the sandboxed program

5. add mkdeb.sh to source code archive
